<h2>TODO List</h2>

This is a todo list assignment to practice skills for making:

<pre>
  a. package.json scripts
  b. webpack.{common,dev,prod}.js
  c. export and import modules
</pre>

Even though the project/assignment asks for todo's, the
implementation here has named it as 'tasks'. Each tasks
can be assigned to a project, or it could exist alone.
The items suggested and implemented in this project:

<pre>
  1. Title for each todo/task                          [done]
  2. Project that each task is assigned to             [done]
